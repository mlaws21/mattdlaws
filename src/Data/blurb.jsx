const blurb = "I am a Senior Computer Science Major at Williams College, interested in a wide variety of topics. Next year I will be attending Northeastern University working with Cristina Nita-Rotaru in the NDS2 lab on applications of security in AI. I recently presented my work at the American Conference for Causal Inference (ACIC) 2025 in a talk focusing on Causal Inference with protein sequences. I have also published a paper in the field of Experimental Algorithms at the Symposium on Experimental Algorithms (SEA) 2024 working on a space efficient Rank and Select Structure. I also enjoy hacking together fun random projects. Outside of academia, I am the Captain of the Rugby Team at Williams and enjoy climbing and camping, and my favorite series is Star Wars."
